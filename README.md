# loans

This started off as just so much more idiarrhea but then became fun to think about (and then after 5 mins of research became a very unoriginal idea, but still!)

It would just be a fun exercise to go through the motions and make a, for example, PawnShop SaaS site that anyone can use to operate a real, physical pawn shop that loans Ether for hocked items of any kind. Situation evolving. ðŸ‘‚

Maybe these are a sort of NFT. That is, a transferrable debt -- transferrable from pawn shop to pawn shop (metaphorically). Isn't an NFT a "uniquly identifiable thing"? combined with a wallet address, this is that.

## "It occurs to me" (up at the top so they are visible to "me")

* Just like on ebay and in real life pawn ships, there may want to be a "sell it now" option. It actually would amount to just finalizing the agreement right away without the buyback opporunity window.
* What if pawnbroker wants to sell "this pile of precious metal"? is there a contract for that?
* There are many laws about identifying people and holding items for X days in case it's stollen, etc. What about that? (...)
* Really, the contract should just have minimal types for the required information. Someone is going to have to keep a bigger database somewhere. We're gonna need a bigger database. Where is it? If it can be "distributed" just a tiny bit, it might really help grease the wheels. Maybe on IPFS a one-line discription for things that are worth tracking (inventoryID?), other stuff elsewhere. Egh.
* How can we retain information like "this pawnbroker has had 1%-er success for the last ten years". Or, something. For examlpe, assessing the value of items. Pawnbrokering starts with "cash" as your capital and then everything you add to that is entirely by pawnbrokering, so in theory it's easier to measure. But if this ever became a thing, the majority of the business would be the old fashioned cash kind. There doesn't seem to be a good way to separate the two. How can you use activity on the blockchain as a way to calculate "success"?
* Is there any reason to try and capture the "bartering" on the blockchain? For example, "How much will you give me for this guitar?" that conversation could be recorded easily. it's just two arrays of numbers, index `0` of one is higher than the other, the two take turns adding numbers. The one that starts high goes lower, the one that starts lower goes higher, until they both pick the same number somewhere in between the starting values. So, cheap to record. Valuable? Slow? Depends on value? Why? Why not?

The pawnbroker assesses an item for its condition and marketability by testing the item and examining it for flaws, scratches or other damage. Another aspect that affects marketability is the supply and demand for the item in the community or region. In some markets, the used goods market is so flooded with used stereos and car stereos, for example, that pawnshops will only accept the higher-quality brand names. Alternatively, a customer may offer to pawn an item that is difficult to sell, such as a surfboard in an inland region, or a pair of snowshoes in warm-winter regions. The pawnshop owner either turns down hard-to-sell items, or offers a low price. While some items never get outdated, such as hammers and hand saws, electronics and computer items quickly become obsolete and unsaleable. Pawnshop owners must learn about different makes and models of computers, software, and other electronic equipment, so they can value objects accurately.

To assess value of different items, pawnbrokers use guidebooks ("blue books"), catalogs, Internet search engines, and their own experience. Some pawnbrokers have trained in identification of gems, or employ a specialist to assess jewelry. One of the risks of accepting secondhand goods is that the item may be counterfeit. If the item is counterfeit, such as a fake Rolex watch, it may have only a fraction of the value of the genuine item. Once the pawnbroker determines the item is genuine and not likely stolen, and that it is marketable, the pawnbroker offers the customer an amount for it. The customer can either sell the item outright if (as in most cases) the pawnbroker is also a licensed secondhand dealer, or offer the item as collateral on a loan. Most pawnshops are willing to negotiate the amount of the loan with the client.

## Original Spewage:

`Pawn.sol` -- Provide enough auditing and reigor to allow loans on the Ethereum network to be secured by pawning real-world objects.
The contract is owned by a "reputable address". When you show up and (perhaps physically) relenquish an item in exchange for a loan, registered with a unique loan ID. You can ONLY sign if your address and loan ID match up to a record in the system. Signing triggers an automatic payment to you of `_loanAmount`, meanwhile, you know that those in control of "reputable address" are in possetion of the item securing the loan, recorded as `_inventoryID`

This stuff can for sure get out of control complicated. Maybe this deserves lots of "interface" treatment like you see in [these folks' contracts](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/tree/186a21a74b327f17fc41217a927dea7064f74604).

* `startPawnAgreement(_inventoryID uint, _loanAmount uint, _pawnee address, _pawnID uint, _payoffAmount uint)` -- When someone shows up to the pawn shop with `_inventoryID` thing and you agree to loan `_loanAmount` to `_pawnee`, requiring the amount of `_payoffAmount` in order for the borrower to recover their item. Note that `_payOffAmount < _loanAmount` need not be forbidden. Maybe this is a parent giving their kid a break with negative interest...? Or maybe this is the European Union and they are doing the same thing.
* `signPawnAgreement(_pawnID)` -- signing is only allowed when `startPawnAgreement` has completed successfully for the given `pawnID`. Calling this triggers an automatic payment of `_loanAmount` to `_pawnee`. This ends the first phase of the transaction ISO compliant pawn brokering. The pawn shop now has your guitar, and when you call this method, you will immediately get your Ether.
* `tweakDealExpiration(???) (???)` -- somehow we need to deal with "expiration" of the deal. If you run out of time, we need to be able to sell your stuff. That's how it works. A nice, neat, logical way to set and maybe adjust the "expiration" is needed. Do we worry much about time stamps here? What exactly keeps a miner from having a grossly-wrong clock? This is a placeholder for such a set of methods (or...)
* `proposeSettlement(_pawnID uint) (_settlementProposalID uint)` -- Borrower is saying "hey, I believe this debt to be satisfied, and am declaring so before the expiration date. You, lender, may now sign indicating agreement, referencing this settlement proposal ID, and return my property, please. Possetion of the 
* `comfirmSettlment(_settlementProposalID) (_inventoryID uint)` -- Um, getting a little bit sloppy. Needs atention. _settlementProposalID should map all the way back to _inventoryID . The point is, we want to record that the property was returned, somehow. Hash of photograph of borrower holding his guitar and today's newspaper?
* `isSettled(_pawnId) (bool)` -- don't know. This needs thinking too.
* ...?
* `showLoawnAgreement(_pawnID uint)` -- I don't know, say you've lost your paperwork. All of the critical info is on the contract, why not have (require) a method to display it? Maybe this could be a `MAY`, in RFC-speak.
* How do we "compose" this with advanced features?
   1. Tour the world of money-borrowing and understand what all the distinct pieces are (orthagonal interfaces)
   1. Maybe, I mean, you could actually strike up a conversation on r/Pawn (or whatever). Why not?
* If you're going to pawn something digital, it's more likely to be an NFT than an ERC20. Or, maybe fungilbe is on a continum. You might have an ERC20 that you can prove is the first-ever minted FooCoin (maybe even that fact will never really earn a premium). Also (!!) you and your trading partner might have opposite opinions about the coins loaned (you think they are one the way down, tradee thinks on the way up) and the collatoral used (same). So I see it is accepting attractive, fine cloth as collateral in exchange for lending ragged, clipped denariuses. Meanwhile the borrower sees it as giving his dishrags as collateral in exchanged for some robust Romain coinage. Both parties "benefit". Even though it seems like for like.
* deadline*S* for payment*S*: we might want that.
